#The subarraySum function is designed to find how many contiguous subarrays within the nums list have a sum equal to k. It achieves this by maintaining a dictionary dic to track cumulative sums encountered as it iterates through nums. For each cumulative sum i, it checks if i - k exists in dic to determine if there's a subarray that sums to k. If found, it increments cnt by the count stored for i - k in dic. Additionally, if i itself equals k, it increments cnt by 1 to account for subarrays starting from the beginning of nums. The function efficiently computes the result with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of nums, and a space complexity of O(n) due to storing cumulative sums in dic.

class Solution:
    def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        cnt=0
        dic={}
        for i in accumulate(nums):
            if i-k in dic:
                cnt+=dic[i-k]
            if i==k:
                cnt+=1
            if i in dic:
                dic[i]+=1
            else:
                dic[i]=1
        return cnt
